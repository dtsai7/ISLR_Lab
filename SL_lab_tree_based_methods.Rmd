```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Decision Trees
```{r}
require(ISLR)
require(tree)
attach(Carseats)

hist(Sales)
High = ifelse(Sales <= 8, "No", "Yes")
Carseats = data.frame(Carseats, High)
```

Fit a tree to these data

Exclude "Sales" from the right-hand side of the formula since the response is derived from it
```{r}
tree.carseats = tree(High ~ . - Sales, data = Carseats)
summary(tree.carseats)
plot(tree.carseats)
text(tree.carseats, pretty = 0)
```

For a detailed summary of the tree, print it:
```{r}
tree.carseats
```
